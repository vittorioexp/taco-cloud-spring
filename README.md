# Taco Cloud

This is the coding exercise proposed by the book "Spring in Action" by Craig Walls. 
I'm developing this project to learn the Spring Framework.

Taco Cloud is a place where you can order tacos online. It enables you to express 
your creative side by letting you desigin custom tacos from a rich palette of ingredients.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo with git clone, as usual.
