# Taco Cloud

This is the project proposed by the book "Spring in Action" by Craig Walls. 
I decided to develop it to learn how to use the Spring Framework.

Taco Cloud is a place where you can order tacos online. 
But more than that, Taco Cloud wants to enable its customers to express 
their creative side and to design custom tacos from a rich palette of ingredients.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo with git clone, as usual.
